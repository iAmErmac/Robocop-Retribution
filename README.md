# Robocop Retribution (VR Enhanced Edition)

![Robocop Retribution](https://i.imgur.com/h4Q0CUV.png)

Robocop Doom is a 17-level total conversion for GZDoom/Doom II developed and released by Mike MacDee (Impie) in 2019. It attempts to recreate the original film in the Doom engine, taking many liberties with the plot like most video game adaptations of the film were known to do. It not only pays tribute to the film series, but the 1988 arcade game as well.

This mod is a VR enhanced modification of Robocop Doom aiming to bring VR centric improvements (for ports like QuestZDoom)
